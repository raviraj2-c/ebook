## Project Structure

### Backend
- **Servlets**: Java servlets in `com/admin/servlet` and `com/user/servlet` handle requests like adding books, managing user profiles, and login/logout operations.
- **Data Access Layer (DAO)**: Interfaces and implementations in `com/DAO` manage database interactions, enabling CRUD operations for books, carts, and users.
- **Database Connection**: `DBconnect.java` provides a utility for connecting to the MySQL database.

### Frontend (JSP Pages)
- **User Pages**: Pages in `src/main/webapp` let users interact with the book catalog, manage their cart, and access their profile and settings.
- **Admin Pages**: Located in `src/main/webapp/admin`, these pages allow admins to manage books and view orders.
- **Shared Components**: Reusable elements like the navigation bar (`navbar.jsp`) and footer (`footer.jsp`), as well as common styling in `style.css`.

### Dependencies
- **MySQL**: Relational database for storing book, user, and order data.
- **JSTL**: JSTL 1.2 library for simplified JSP development.
